# MobileCi

A freelance web project written in Angular, which core function is to act as the web platform config page for setting up and running / managing CI/CD flow, specifically for iOS (Android to come later). The main intention was to simplify the complexity of setting up and running your own CI/CD flow, to the point of being easily used by even non-tech users. Backend was written in XMPP. Core frameworks include reactive forms and auth.
